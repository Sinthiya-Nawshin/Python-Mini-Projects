# Python-Mini-Projects
Being a CS graduate, programming was always soooo boring to me. Mostly because I thought I didn't have the brains and enough dedication for it. 
After years of contemplation, I finally found some motivation to try learning the easiest and most popular one - Python. 
Now, I don't want to be the best of them, I just want to be one of them (nerd).
And what even is the best quality of a programmer? Patience? Eh, I can be patient!
So far my little brain is doing it's job very well. I hope I can keep up with this learning process for as long as I can.
'Cause for the very first time, I'm enjoying it. 
Since I'm very new to Python, this repository contains some of the most basic problem solving "mini projects" (as I like to call them).
I'll keep updating my "beginner -> intermediate -> advanced" journey as I go. 
Thank you for reading this.
